# Annotations

The following are the available annotations for the injector.  These annotations 
are organized into two sections: agent and vault.  All of the annotations below 
change the configurations of the Vault Agent containers injected into the pod.

## Agent Annotations

Agent annotations change the Vault Agent containers templating configuration.  For 
example, agent annotations allow users to define what secrets they want, how to render 
them, optional commands to run, etc.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject` - configures whether injection is explicitly
  enabled or disabled for a pod. This should be set to a `true` or `false` value.
  Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-status` - blocks further mutations
  by adding the value `injected` to the pod after a successful mutation.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-configmap` - name of the configuration map where Vault
  Agent configuration file and templates can be found.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-image` - name of the Vault docker image to use. This
  value overrides the default image configured in the controller and is usually
  not needed. Defaults to `vault:1.3.2`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-init-first` - configures the pod to run the Vault Agent 
  init container first if `true` (last if `false`).  This is useful when other init 
  containers need pre-populated secrets.  This should be set to a `true` or `false` 
  value.  Defaults to `false`. 

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-command` - configures Vault Agent
  to run a command after the template has been rendered.  To map a command to a specific 
  secret, use the same unique secret name: `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-command-SECRET-NAME`.
  For example, if a secret annotation `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foobar` 
  is configured, `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-command-foobar` would map a command 
  to that secret.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret` - configures Vault Agent
  to retrieve the secrets from Vault required by the container. The name of the
  secret is any unique string after `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-`,
  such as `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foobar`. The value is the path
  in Vault where the secret is located.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template` - configures the template Vault Agent
  should use for rendering a secret. The name of the template is any
  unique string after `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-`, such as
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-foobar`. This should map to the same
  unique value provided in `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-`. If not provided,
  a default generic template is used.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-token` - configures Vault Agent to share the Vault 
  token with other containers in the pod.  This is helpful when other containers 
  communicate directly with Vault but require auto-authentication provided by Vault 
  Agent.  This should be set to a `true` or `false` value.  Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-limits-cpu` - configures the CPU limits on the Vault
  Agent containers. Defaults to `500m`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-limits-mem` - configures the memory limits on the Vault
  Agent containers. Defaults to `128Mi`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-requests-cpu` - configures the CPU requests on the
  Vault Agent containers. Defaults to `250m`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-requests-mem` - configures the memory requests on the
  Vault Agent containers. Defaults to `64Mi`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-revoke-on-shutdown` - configures whether the sidecar 
  will revoke it's own token before shutting down.  This setting will only be applied 
  to the Vault Agent sidecar container.  This should be set to a `true` or `false` 
  value. Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-revoke-grace` - configures the grace period, in seconds, 
  for revoking it's own token before shutting down.  This setting will only be applied
  to the Vault Agent sidecar container.  Defaults to `5s`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-pre-populate` - configures whether an init container
  is included to pre-populate the shared memory volume with secrets prior to the
  containers starting.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-pre-populate-only` - configures whether an init container
  is the only injected container. If true, no sidecar container will be injected
  at runtime of the pod.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/preserve-secret-case` - configures Vault Agent to preserve 
  the secret name case when creating the secret files. This should be set to a `true` 
  or `false` value.  Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/secret-volume-path` - configures where on the filesystem a secret 
  will be rendered.  To map a path to a specific secret, use the same unique secret name: 
  `vault.hashicorp.com/secret-volume-path-SECRET-NAME`. For example, if a secret annotation 
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foobar` is configured, 
  `vault.hashicorp.com/secret-volume-path-foobar` would configure where that secret 
  is rendered.  If no secret name is provided, this sets the default for all rendered 
  secrets in the pod.

## Vault Annotations

Vault annotations change how the Vault Agent containers communicate with Vault.  For 
example, Vault's address, TLS certificates to use, client parameters such as timeouts, 
etc. 

- `vault.hashicorp.com/auth-path` - configures the auth path for the Kubernetes 
  auth method.  Defaults to `kubernetes`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/ca-cert` - path of the CA certificate used to verify Vault's
  TLS.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/ca-key` - path of the CA public key used to verify Vault's
  TLS.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/client-cert` - path of the client certificate used when
  communicating with Vault via mTLS.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/client-key` - path of the client public key used when communicating
  with Vault via mTLS.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/client-max-retries` - configures number of Vault Agent retry
  attempts when 5xx errors are encountered. Defaults to 2.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/client-timeout` - configures the request timeout threshold,
  in seconds, of the Vault Agent when communicating with Vault. Defaults to `60s`
  and accepts value types of `60`, `60s` or `1m`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/log-level` - configures the verbosity of the Vault Agent 
  log level.  Default is `info`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/namespace` - configures the Vault Enterprise namespace to 
  be used when requesting secrets from Vault.  

- `vault.hashicorp.com/role` - configures the Vault role used by the Vault Agent
  auto-auth method. Required when `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-configmap` is not set.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/service` - name of the Vault service to use. This value
  overrides the default service configured in the controller and is usually not
  needed.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/tls-secret` - name of the Kubernetes secret containing TLS
  Client and CA certificates and keys. This is mounted to `/vault/tls`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/tls-server-name` - name of the Vault server to verify the
  authenticity of the server when communicating with Vault over TLS.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/tls-skip-verify` - if true, configures the Vault Agent to
  skip verification of Vault's TLS certificate. It's not recommended to set this
  value to true in a production environment.
