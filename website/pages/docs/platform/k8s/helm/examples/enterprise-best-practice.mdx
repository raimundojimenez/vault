# Vault Enterprise Best Practices Cluster

~> **Important Note:** This chart is not compatible with Helm 2. Please use Helm 3 with this chart.

Vault's enterprise features focus around replication. Typically, one cluster is a leader, and other
clusters are followers. There are two main types of following clusters. Disaster replication clusters
serve as a warm standby should the leader cluster stop serving traffic. Performance replication
clusters increase the number of reads that Vault can service.

AWS is given here in depth as a sample for auto-unseal, but any [auto-unseal](/docs/configuration/seal)
mechanism may be used.

## Walk-Through

1. Create an EKS cluster. This walk-through will assume it's named "vault-cluster".
2. While the cluster is launching, create a role for Vault's node group to use.
   [AWS's docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/worker_node_IAM_role.html)
   should be considered the authority on the policies that need to be attached, but at the time
   of writing, the required policies are the `AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy`, the `AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy`,
   and the `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly`. For the purposes of this walk-through, we will
   assume you name this new role, "EKSNodeGroupForAutoUnseal".
3. While the cluster is launching, also create a KMS key that will be used for auto-unseal.
   Under "Define key usage permissions", search for "EKSNodeGroupForAutoUnseal" and add a check
   next to it.
4. One you've finished creating the key, return to IAM. Create a new policy called
   "UnsealKeyUsageForVault" and attach it to the "EKSNodeGroupForAutoUnseal" role. The policy
   contents should be:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:Encrypt",
                "kms:DescribeKey"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:012345678901:key/207a68f5-f100-410c-8066-EXAMPLE"
        }
    ]
}
```

5. Return to EKS and add a node group. While launching it, under "Node IAM Role Name", select
   "EKSNodeGroupForAutoUnseal".
6. While the nodes are creating, point your local `kubectl` at your new cluster as shown
   [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-kubeconfig.html).

## Generate TLS Certificates

TLS certificate generation is covered [here](/docs/platform/k8s/helm/examples/standalone-tls).

## Setting Up the Primary Cluster

The below `values-custom.yaml` can be used to set up a three server Vault cluster using
Consul as a highly available storage backend, with AWS KMS for Auto Unseal.

```yaml
# Create a values-custom.yaml to override default values
cat << EOF > values-custom.yaml
server:
  image:
    repository: "hashicorp/vault-enterprise"
    tag: "1.4.0_ent"

  affinity: |
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: {{ template "vault.name" . }}
              release: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
              component: server
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname

  ha:
    enabled: true
    replicas: 3

    config: |
      ui = true

      service_registration "kubernetes" {
        namespace      = "my-namespace"
        pod_name       = "my-pod-name"
      }

      listener "tcp" {
        tls_cert_file = "/path/to/fullchain.pem"
        tls_key_file  = "/path/to/privkey.pem"
        tls_client_ca_file = "/vault/userconfig/vault-server-tls/vault.ca"
        address = "[::]:8200"
        cluster_address = "[::]:8201"
      }

      storage "consul" {
        path = "vault-us-east"
        address = "HOST_IP:8500"
        token = "45a3bd52-07c7-47a4-52fd-0745e0cfe967"
      }

      seal "awskms" {
        region     = "us-east-2"
        kms_key_id = "19ec80b0-dfdd-4d97-8164-c6examplekey"
      }
EOF
```

Next, point Helm to the chart release and specify the `values-custom.yaml` file:

```
helm install vault-us-east hashicorp/vault -f values-custom.yaml
```

Note that in the above seal stanza, the AWS key and secret are omitted. That's because
Vault picks them up from the node group's Instance Metadata, which in this example has
been configured to provide credentials for the "EKSNodeGroupForAutoUnseal" role.

Also note that the `namespace` and `pod_name` in the service registration stanza can
alternatively be set using the Downward API. Please see
[Kubernetes Service Registration](/docs/configuration/service-registration/kubernetes)
for elaboration.

Lastly, note that the `path` for `consul` is set to `vault-us-east`. This is because, in
a replicated environment, we would expect other clusters to be in other regions such as
`vault-us-west`. A similar distinction was made in the `helm install` command's naming
convention.

After bringing up the first cluster (and each cluster thereafter), Vault enterprise
requires a license to be installed within a limited time window, as shown
[here](/api-docs/system/license#install-license).

## Setting Up a Disaster Replication (DR) Cluster

Setting up a DR cluster follows an identical process and configuration for
creating the cluster itself, but presumably in a different region. This would
necessitate changing the value under `consul` and `path` to one relevant to the
region for the DR cluster, such as `vault-us-west`, as well as the `[NAME]` used
in the `helm install` command.

Once the cluster is up and the license is added, add it as a follower to the leader
cluster. See [Disaster Recovery Replication Setup](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/operations/ops-disaster-recovery)
for more information.

## Setting Up a Performance Cluster

Setting up a performance cluster also follows an identical process and configuration
for creating the cluster itself, with the region differentiations noted above.

Once the cluster is up and the license is added, add it as a follower to the leader
cluster. See [Setting Up Performance Replication](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/operations/ops-replication)
for more on how to configure a cluster to follow the primary once it is up.
